# Phonology Segment and Feature Engine

Feature phonology tool. Compute natural classes, find minimal distinguishing feature bundles, and edit segment inventories.

Browser version: <https://jhnwnstd.github.io/phono-feature/>.

## Features

- Edit and create segment inventories.
- Select any set of segments to see the features they share, the features that split them, and the minimal feature bundle that uniquely characterizes the set (when one exists).
- Toggle feature values to query in the other direction: find every segment matching a `+`/`-` spec.

## Run

Requires [Python 3.11+](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

| OS | Launcher |
|---|---|
| macOS | `RUN-Mac.command` |
| Windows | `RUN-Windows.bat` |
| Linux | `RUN-Linux.sh` |

The first launch sets up the app. Later launches start immediately.

### OS notes

macOS may block unsigned command files. Right click `RUN-Mac.command`, choose **Open**, then confirm.

Windows may show a SmartScreen warning. Click **More info**, then **Run anyway**.

Linux file managers may refuse to launch shell scripts; run from a terminal instead. If you get a permission error, `chmod +x RUN-Linux.sh` first.

## Inventories

Bundled inventories live in `app/inventories/` and appear in the app menu.

| File                    | Description                    |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| `hayes_features.json`   | Hayes 2009 inventory           |
| `general_features.json` | General IPA oriented inventory |
| `english_features.json` | English oriented inventory     |

You can add and build inventories through **New Inventory** in the app.

## Development

The engine is pure Python in `packages/phonology-engine/`. The desktop GUI in `app/` uses PyQt6 and depends on the engine. The browser version in `web/` reuses the same engine via Pyodide.

[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) covers the relay system, the three-tier `gui/` layout, how the launchers are wired, and where the tests live. [web/README.md](web/README.md) covers the web build internals and what gets relayed from the desktop sources.

The launcher creates `app/.venv/` and installs both packages editable. Activate it to run the tests:

```bash
./RUN-Linux.sh                                  # creates app/.venv
source app/.venv/bin/activate
pytest app/tests                                # GUI + integration
pytest packages/phonology-engine/tests          # engine, no Qt
```

Manual setup without the launcher (any OS):

```bash
python -m venv app/.venv
source app/.venv/bin/activate                   # Windows: app\.venv\Scripts\activate.bat
pip install -e packages/phonology-engine -e "app[dev]"
```
